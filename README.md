# python-imagej-starter

A starter project for a Python + ImageJ project

## setup

You will want to follow the instructions for [pyimagej](https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej). I followed ["Installing via pip"
](https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej/blob/master/doc/Install.md#installing-via-pip) steps specifically.

In a nutshell, you will need to have:

- Installed Python 3
- Installed OpenJDK 8 or 11
- Installed Maven: https://maven.apache.org/
- Installed pyimagej `pip install imagej`
